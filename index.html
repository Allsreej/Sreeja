                Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts and is sorted into Gryffindor House.
                He gains the friendship of Ron Weasley, a member of a large but poor 
                wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch of non-magical, or Muggle,
                parentage. The trio develop an enmity with the rich pure-blood student Draco Malfoy.
                Harry encounters the school's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore; the potions professor,
                Severus Snape, who displays a dislike for him; and the Defence Against the Dark 
                Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell. Quirrell turns out to be allied with Voldemort,
                who is still alive as a weak spirit. The first book concludes with Harry's 
                confrontation with Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to
                possess the Philosopher's Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life.

                The novels fall into the genre of fantasy literature, and qualify
                as a type of fantasy called "urban fantasy", "contemporary fantasy",
                or "low fantasy". They are mainly dramas, and maintain a fairly serious
                and dark tone throughout, though they do contain some notable instances 
                of tragicomedy and black humour. In many respects, they are also examples 
                of the bildungsroman, or coming of age novel,and contain elements of 
                mystery, adventure, horror, thriller, and romance. The books are also,
                in the words of Stephen King, "shrewd mystery tales",[9] and each book
                is constructed in the manner of a Sherlock Holmes-style mystery adventure.
                The stories are told from a third person limited point of view with 
                very few exceptions (such as the opening chapters of Philosopher's Stone,
                Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows and the first two chapters of Half-Blood Prince).

                The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the
                 United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. A series 
                 of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and 
                 the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller,
                  adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores 
                  numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.
                  Major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, madness, and death.
